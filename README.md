Info for each technical project


Welcome to the GitHub repository that I host as a sidekick to my tech videos on my YouTube channel.

Here you'll find folders with info inside for a specific project that I have done. Folders will be named after their corresponding videos on the YouTube channel to
make things easy.

There is no fancy formatting or GitHub website for anything, but if someone wants
to take the time to create and maintain something like it, let me know! I hate to leave things as plain text, or poor formatting, but I can't spend tons of time 
making everything nice and pretty. If you are here from one of my videos, it's clear you are looking for specific information and resources, so I will lay that out 
nicely in plain text.

If you want to make a comment or correct some info, do a pull request with the corrections. DO NOT EMAIL me about changes. GitHub has the tools for this :D

Enjoy the resources! I want to make things easy for projects :D
